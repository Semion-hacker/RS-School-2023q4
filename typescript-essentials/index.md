## Reflections

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**  
*In this module I became acquainted with the TypeScript language. I also found out why it was created. I learned how to use the TypeScript language. I also tried setting up the TypeScript development environment myself.*
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**  
*In this module, I learned the main advantages of declaring typed variables in TypeScript. I also learned about primitive types, object types, union types, and intersection types.*
3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**  
*In this module I learned the reasons for using an interface in TypeScript. I also became familiar with interface instances. I learned how to expand the interface. Learned how to declare an interface with custom array types.*
4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**  
*In this module I learned that it is better to use types in functions. Learned how to write functions that have mandatory, optional, default and other parameters. Learned how to define function types using type aliases or interfaces.*
5. **Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**  
*In this module I learned how to use TypeScript classes to describe the shape of objects. Learned to determine when to use an interface or class to define the structure of an object. I also learned how to create an instance of a class using TypeScript. Learned how to use class access modifiers. Learned how to declare a class that extends another class.
And how to declare an interface to provide the form of a class.*
6. **Generics in TypeScript**  
*In this module I learned everything about generics. Learned to define a general function. Learned to declare a universal class and implement general restrictions.*
7. **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**  
*In this module I learned how to organize code using modules. I also learned how to import an external type library.*
8. **Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**  
*In this module I learned how to implement single-file namespaces. And also multi-file namespaces. Learned about the main features of designing the use of namespaces and modules. Well, I found out about their (namespaces) purpose*
